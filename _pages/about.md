Welcome to my blog! I am Chao Huang, a first year graduate student persuing Master of Data Sicence degree at Columbia University. I am interested in recommender systems and data privacy. Previous undergraduate years have opened the door of data mining for me, and I am really passionate about persuing a professional career in related fields in the near future. Feel free to visit the projects and blog pages and I'm looking forward to hearing from you!
